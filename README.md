# 🦠 Covid-19 Data Exploration

## Objective

This project focuses on the **exploratory analysis of global COVID-19 data** to identify trends, patterns, and key indicators throughout the pandemic.  
The objective is to transform raw public health data into **clear, structured insights** that support analytical reasoning and effective data-driven storytelling.

The analysis emphasizes:
- Trend identification over time  
- Comparative insights across regions and countries  
- Preparation of analytical datasets for visualization and reporting

## Dataset

The project uses publicly available data provided by **Our World in Data**, covering the period from **January 1, 2020 to July 5, 2021**.

- **Source:** Our World in Data – COVID-19 Dataset  
- **Link:** https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths  
- **Scope:** Global data including cases, deaths, population metrics, and vaccination-related variables

## Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft SQL Server 2019**  
  Used for data exploration, filtering, aggregation, window functions, and transformation of large datasets.

  👉 [SQL Scripts](https://github.com/arza1uz/Covid-19-Data-Exploration/blob/main/COVID%20portfolio%20project%20V1.sql)

- **Tableau**  
  Used to design interactive dashboards that communicate insights in a clear and intuitive way.

## Key Business Questions Answered

This analysis addresses several analytical questions commonly encountered in business intelligence and data analytics scenarios:

- How did COVID-19 cases and deaths evolve globally over time?
- Which countries and regions experienced the highest infection rates relative to population size?
- How do mortality rates compare across countries and continents?
- What percentage of the population was infected at different stages of the pandemic?
- How did vaccination progress differ across countries when adjusted for population?
- Which regions were most impacted when comparing absolute values versus relative metrics?

These questions guide the analytical process and ensure that the insights produced are **relevant, interpretable, and actionable**.
